# Simple Form 

Creating a simple form to store user data like **Name, Gmail, Phone number, and Confirmation using PHP and MySQL** involves a straightforward process. First, you'll design an HTML form where users can input their information. This form should include fields for name, Gmail (email address), phone number, and a confirmation checkbox to ensure user consent. Each input field is associated with a unique name attribute for identification. When the user submits the form, the data is sent to a PHP script for processing.

In the PHP script, you establish a connection to your MySQL database using credentials like the server name, username, password, and database name. After verifying the connection, you retrieve the data submitted through the form using the $_POST superglobal. You then construct an SQL query to insert this data into a database table designed to store user information. If the insertion is successful, a confirmation message is displayed; otherwise, an error message is shown. Finally, you close the database connection. This simple form-to-database system allows for the efficient collection and storage of user data, making it accessible for future use or analysis.
